OK so lets assume we are all just using JetBrains IDE (phpstorm or webstorm), to setup comperser and install apps:

1. Hop under Tools -> Composer -> Init Composer...
2. Click Download Composer
3. Select the root directory of your app
4. Click OK
5. And you are done...

And if you are not using an IDE, just go to getcomposer.org and play with bash lol

To install sendgrid on JetBrains IDE:

1. Under Tools -> Composer -> Add Dependencies
2. Search for `sendgrid/sendgrid`
3. Click Add
4. And you are done :)

You need to install php for any of this to work, but that will be too much for me to type... Just go search it on google on how to do it -,-
