### Setting up the Composer and Dependencies

We will assume you use JetBrains IDE (phpstorm or webstorm), to setup composer and install apps:

1. Hop under Tools -> Composer -> Init Composer...
2. Click Download Composer
3. Select the root directory of your app
4. Click OK
5. And you are done...

And if you are not using an IDE, just go to getcomposer.org and play with bash.

To install sendgrid on JetBrains IDE:

1. Under Tools -> Composer -> Add Dependencies
2. Search for `sendgrid/sendgrid`
3. Click Add
4. And you are done :)

You need to install php for any of this to work, here is a link to a proper guide: http://php.net/manual/en/install.php
