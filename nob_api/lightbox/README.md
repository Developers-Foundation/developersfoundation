## Lightbox

A custom Lightbox for photos, similar to one provided by bootstrap.

OK no longer on alpha, I'd say its pretty much beta or done.

For this to work on your bootstrap, you will have to write up some custom classes to override those provided in bootstrap.
Still need to test this on other themes.
