# CMS Vision

| Written by | Harrison Chow |

TLDR; The Developers’ Foundation’s Content Management System (CMS) will be a platform that will be used by tens, and hundred of Charities to support their own cause. The goal of this infrastructure is to help charities easily manage their content from a customized personal dashboard.

### Back Story
Since the beginning, we have developed websites for our clients, and the development cycle is as follows:
1. Discovery: Learning more about the client themselves and discovering the possibilities of Developers' Foundation
2. Specifications: Defining the specifics of the project by specifications built with the client
3. Content request: TPM requests and receives content from the client, including but not limited to pictures, documents, paragraphs etc
4. Initial development and designs: Development team and designers give a first crack at the project with what they have, this usually starts before step three if product content is slow
5. Alpha show and tell: Developers and TPM shows alpha version of the product to the client
6. Touch ups and fixes: Changes are applied based on client feedback
7. Product complete and deployment: Product is officially deployed
8. Fix and corrections iterations: Changes can be done if requested by clients

The problem we had with this type of product development is that steps with interactions with the client has been delaying the product completion times. Such as content request step (3) has been our greatest barrier to finishing the products, especially since developers and designers do not know what approach to take on the product. This has led to a long list of products yet to be completed. By implementing the CMS, we hope to solve this great issue in the product development cycle.
 
The CMS should allow clients to access it via a simple username and password access, and allow them to add and edit the content on the website. With this type of content submission system in place, the client is free to change or add content to their site at their own discretion and pace. The development can also then be done as long as a design has been agreed on, where the developers will only need to put in "data pulling" tags in where data should appear.

### Current Development

Current CMS development is done by Harrison Chow (Western) and Jashan (Waterloo). Current status of the CMS is as follows:
- Core framework
- Basic database connections
- Basic user management
- Microsoft 360 implementations
- Basic website edit features


### Future Development

TODOs:
- Endpoints on CMS
- PHP plugin to allow one-line integration
- Client login system
- Extended Microsoft 360 implementations (other features such as oneDrive)
- Other services implementations (Cloudflare - DNS controls, Google Analytics etc)
